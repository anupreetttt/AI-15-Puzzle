# AI-15-Puzzle

## Description: 
In this project I have created a JavaFX program that will allow the user to attempt to solve different 15 puzzles (more on that below). The program have a minimum of 10 unique 15 puzzles to solve. If the user can not solve it and wants to see the solution, animated move by move, they can choose to have the AI puzzle solver figure it out with one of two heuristics.
